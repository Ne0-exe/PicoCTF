#### Description

_A digital ghost has breached my defenses, and my sensitive data has been stolen!_ ðŸ˜±ðŸ’» _Your mission is to uncover how this phantom intruder infiltrated my system and retrieve the hidden flag. To solve this challenge, you'll need to analyze the provided PCAP file and track down the attack method. The attacker has cleverly concealed his moves in well timely manner. Dive into the network traffic, apply the right filters and show off your forensic prowess and unmask the digital intruder!_

## Overview

In this CTF challenge, the objective was to extract a flag from network traffic captured in a file. The process began with the acquisition of a packet capture (PCAP) file named `myNetworkTraffic.pcap`

## Solution

The first step involved opening the PCAP file using Wireshark, a widely-used network protocol analyzer that enables users to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network. This provided an overview of the network traffic, which was primarily composed of TCP protocol communications containing obfuscated text.

To further analyze the traffic, the decision was made to utilize TShark, which is the command-line version of Wireshark and is useful for processing and analyzing packet data in a more automated fashion.

1. **Command: `tshark -r myNetworkTraffic.pcap`**  
   This command reads the specified PCAP file and displays the packet data in the terminal. It allows for a quick review of the captured packets, providing insights into the types of traffic present.

2. **Command: `tshark -r myNetworkTraffic.pcap -T fields -e tcp.payload`**  
   This command extracts the TCP payloads from the packets in the PCAP file. By specifying `-T fields` and `-e tcp.payload`, it filters the output to show only the TCP payload data, which is essential for identifying any hidden information or flags.

3. **Command: `tshark -r myNetworkTraffic.pcap -T fields -e tcp.payload | xxd -p -r | base64 -d`**  
   This command takes the TCP payloads extracted from the previous command and pipes them through two additional processes. The `xxd -p -r` command converts the hexadecimal representation of the payload back into binary format.

   Convertion revealed additional encoding. That is why there was a need to include `base64 -d` command in the pipeline that decodes any Base64-encoded data. This step was crucial in revealing the underlying information hidden within the TCP payloads.

5. **Command: `tshark -r myNetworkTraffic.pcap -T fields -e tcp.payload -Y "tcplen==12" | xxd -p -r | base64 -d`**  
   Here, the command is modified to filter the TCP payloads to only those with a length of 12 bytes using the display filter `-Y "tcplen==12"`. This targeted approach helps in narrowing down the search for the flag by focusing on payloads of a specific size, which may contain the flag. Investigating packet using wireshark revealed that size of TCP payload fluctuates around 12 and 4 Bytes.

By then it was clear that this is a right path, but unfortunately there was something wrong with the order. Basing on the first column with timing of each packet it was quite obvious that it needs to be fixed.

6. **Command: `tshark -r myNetworkTraffic.pcap -T fields -e frame.time -e tcp.payload -Y "tcplen==12 || tcp.len==4" | sort -k4 | awk '{print $6}' | xxd -p -r | base64 -d`**  
   In the final command, the filtering is expanded to include TCP payloads with a length of either 12 bytes or 4 bytes (`-Y "tcplen==12 || tcp.len==4"`) and sorting packets in right time manner (`-e frame.time`). The results are sorted based on the fourth field, and the sixth field is extracted using `awk`. The extracted data is then processed through `xxd -p -r` and `base64 -d` to decode the information. This comprehensive command ultimately revealed the flag hidden within the network traffic.
