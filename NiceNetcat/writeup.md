**Nice Netcat... on PicoCtf by Ne0exe 30.10.2022**

Alright, first of all: what is netcat?
*Netcat* is scanning and monitoring tool (it is also a simple server) based on TCP/IP communication. It just reads and saves data during network connection thanks to the TCP or UDP.

And Pico wants us to talk to it. Ok, let's try it.

Brainstorming and .......... first thing that comes to my mind is ASCII. After checking the ASCII table I can say that there is a high probability that I'm right becasue for example 112 is *p* and 105 is *i*. But I'm not gonna do this manually, let's put chef to work.
